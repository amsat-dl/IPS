This is IPS-M  v2.05 for Acorn Risc Computers.  Please read the whole of this
file before you get hacking.

To Run
------
Double-click on the blue-ish icon  !IPS-M

To Use
------
Input, output and operation is as described in the book "IPS - High Level
Programming of Small Systems" by Karl Meinzer (1978), ISBN 0-9530507-0-X.
There are minor differences:

 - Standard words are in German.  
 - At errors, the offending word is displayed in inverse video and the cursor
   placed at the start of the word.
 - The cursor control keys may also be used.  

OUTPUT: Is virtually identical to IPS-N for the Atari 800XL etc

INPUT:  1. You enter commands by typing them in the usual way.

        2. Or you can read a file.  For example, enter:

          " TRIG " READ   <ret>
      
Note that the default directory is called "Work" and is inside the
application.  Keep your hacks in there.

Quitting
--------
Hit ESCAPE.

If you hold down SHIFT at the same time, a screendump is placed in RAM disc.

IPS-M Design
------------
A listing of the IPS-M source is supplied in   Docs.Listing .

The M-9097 Meinzer Computer has 64K of memory, used as follows:

  Screen Buffer:    #000 -  #3FF
  Syspage:          #400 -  #4FF
  IPS:              #500 - #14FA
  User:            #14FB - #xxxx
  Parameter stack: #xxxx - #FFF8
  Return stack:     #440 -  #4F8
  
Code routines are in an imaginary 8K ROM.

The stacks are "Full-Descending" type with the LS byte at the lower address.

The Generic IPS Specification Draft C is implemented (as per the paper copy),
with the exception of assembler-oriented utilities:
           RCODE  CODE  NEXT  ERZ>  MACHT> MACHT/CODE>  I>  <I

There are 8 chain positions, numbered 0 - 7, accessed with EINH and AUSH.
The stack display routine is allocated to chain position 0.
The time is at UHR, and the four stopwatches are included SU0 - SU3 .


Additional words: (IPS Spec. Draft E) familiar from IPS-C:
----------------
P/      is like P/MOD but returns the quotient only.  See IPS Spec.

CHS     changes the sign of the item on the stack

        <n>  CHS
        <-n>

CYC2    takes 16-bit seed and a byte and returns the crcc'd value.
        Typically used in a loop, e.g   #FFFF 0 511 JE I @B CYC2 NUN 

        <seed>  <byte> CYC2
        <new seed>
        
P+      double-length addition.  Adds two 32-bit numbers and returns result
        on the stack

        <ls word A>   <ms word A>   <ls word B>   <ms word B>  P+
        <ls word A+B> <ms word A+B>
        
P-      double-length subtraction; similar to P+

        <ls word A>   <ms word A>   <ls word B>   <ms word B>  P-
        <ls word A-B> <ms word A-B>


New words:  CLS  LANG  READ  $SAVE  $LOAD  OSCLI  S-ON  $TVS  DEFCHAR
---------
CLS     Clears the stack; Clear Screen.  This word cannot be used inside a
        definition.   (Type is :INT)

        CLS
        empty
        

LANG    Sets language for error messages;  0 = German,  1 = English

        < language > LANG
        empty
        

READ    Executes a file.   This will read the file, compile definitions
        therein and execute any commands.

        < " FileName " >  READ
        empty

        Error conditions:
          No filename.
          File not found etc.
          On error, 2 bytes are left on the stack.
          
        Example:
        
        " TRIG " READ               Loads and compiles trigonometry library  
          
        This word cannot be used inside a definition.


$SAVE   Saves a block of memory to file.  Start address, limit address
        ( = final address + 1 ) and a file name must be specified.
        Saved block size is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes.
        
        This word cannot be used inside a definition.

        <start_address>  <limit_address> < " FileName " >  $SAVE
        empty

        Examples:
        
        #400  #500  " Syspage "    $SAVE   write 512 bytes to a file named
                                           "Syspage" in the current directory.
                                           
        #0 #FFFF    " ^.M-bin "    $SAVE   saves entire IPS memory to the
                                           IPS-M application directory
                                           overwriting the standard build.(*)
                                          
        Error conditions:
          Block length specified zero or negative.
          Bad filename; existing file locked or open, or is a directory etc.
          On error, start and limit addresses are left on the stack.

(*) Notes  
So next time you run IPS-M, it will start up exactly as you saved it, new
definitions, chain, time and screen included.  The stack will however be
empty.

For your safety, a spare copy of the original IPS image M-bin is retained in
the Work directory!

You might choose use another name to save "your" IPS.  For example with, #0
#FFFF  " MyBuild " $SAVE .  This can be invoked after start-up by using the
$LOAD command (see below).  Alternatively you can edit the application's !Run
file to invoke  Work.MyBuild   rather than the specified  M-bin .

You might not wish to save the screen, and you might not have any work beyond
HIER.  So you could enter:  #400 HIER " MyBuild2 " $SAVE . Of course you MUST
re-load this to #400 see below), and never invoke such a file from the !Run
file, which always loads to the start of IPS memory (#0000).  
          
                 


$LOAD   Loads a file to memory.  Load address and file name must be specified.
        This word cannot be used inside a definition.

        <load_address> < " FileName " >  $LOAD
        empty

        Example:

        #2000  " ArrayData " $LOAD          Loads the file "ArrayData" to
                                            memory address #2000 

        #0     " ^.M-bin "   $LOAD          Re-start IPS
        
        #0     " MyBuild "   $LOAD          Re-start IPS using "your" build
                                            ( see $SAVE notes )
        #400   " MyBuild2 "  $LOAD          Re-start IPS without screen data
                                            ( see $SAVE notes )


        Error conditions:
          File not an IPS binary image.
          File too big; will overflow memory.  File is zero length.
          File not found etc.
          On error, load address is left on the stack.
          

OSCLI   Send a command to the Acorn Operating System.
        (Note: "OSCLI" = Operating System Command Line Interpreter)
        This word cannot be used inside a definition.

        < " Command " > OSCLI
        empty.

        Examples:

        " Cat "          OSCLI   Catalogue of files in current directory
        " Info "         OSCLI   Detailed Catalogue   
        " Del. tmp "     OSCLI   Delete the file "tmp" from current directory
        " Type NewChar " OSCLI   List contents of the file "NewChar"
        "   "            OSCLI   Clear the oscli screen

        Error conditions:
         Invalid command.  (Up to 2 words may be left on the stack).
         

S-ON    Stack display on.
        You turn the stack display off with 0 AUSH .
        
$TVS    The stack display is positioned on-screen at the address given by
        the constant $TVS .  To place the stack display elsewhere, for example
        on the 6th line, enter:   #140   ? $TVS ! 
        
        
DEFCHAR  Re-define a character font.   
         This word cannot be used inside a definition.
         
         <n1> <n2> <n3> <n4> <n5> <n6> <n7> <n8>  <char>  DEFCHAR
         
         Each of the 128 displayable characters is defined in an 8x8 bit
         grid.  You may change any character by respecifying these 8 bytes.
         Characters 0-31 are unused.  char must be in the range 0-127.
         
         Example: Redefine character 17 to be triangle
         
           L      M
           01234567    Hex
           --------    ---
           ##......    #03
           ###.....    #07
           ####....    #0F
           ##.##...    #1B
           ##..##..    #33
           ##...##.    #63
           ########    #FF
           ........    #00

           #03 #07 #0F #1B #33 #63 #FF #00   17  DEFCHAR
           
         Note the reversed order of the bits in a specification byte.
           
         You can display the entire character set with:
            : DISPLAY   0 255 JE I I TV4 + !B NUN ;   DISPLAY
            
         Try this example:  " NewChar " READ


         
Trigonometry Words:      TR-LOOP   RP-LOOP   3V3
------------------
        Refer to the documentation file "Docs.Trig" for details of
        trigonometry code routines and see the library file "Work.TRIG".
 
_____________________________________________________________________________

Program Notes
-------------
The M-9097 engine ( !RunImage ) is written in ARM machine code.  Via the
emulator loop it supports the ~64 code routines referenced from M-bin.  It
also services keyboard input, file i/o, 20ms clocks and screen display.

Loop speeds:

  Machine         Emulator      Chain
  --------------------------------------------
  A3010           4.49  us    146    us
  RISCPC/SA       0.127 us      3.91 us
  --------------------------------------------


"Emulator" means the time taken to go round the emulator loop, excluding any
code routines.  The emulator is presently 12 ARM code instructions, and a
typical IPS code routine averages 7 instructions including the return. (e.g.
WEG takes 2 instructions, RDU takes 13) 

"Chain" means the time taken to idle through one complete chain, consisting
of the Compiler, Stack Display, and 7x NOOPs.  It's approximately 40 IPS
words if there is no processing to be done.

This was scanned by Bill Roth N7RYW from the original photocopy document, and
is gratefully acknowledged.

The ASCII was then corrected for scanning errors by JRM, then additions/
updates made, mainly at the end.

There is, as of 1997 Feb 08, some more to be included, since the original
ASCII file has come to light. (Tnx Robin Gape).  A revision is pending.
