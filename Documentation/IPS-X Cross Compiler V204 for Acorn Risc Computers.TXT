This is a copy of IPS Cross Compiler v2.04 for Acorn Risc Computers.
Please read the whole of this file before you get hacking.

A good understanding of IPS is assumed, and you are strongly advised to
read the companion instructions supplied with normal IPS-M.


To Run
------
Double-click on the white-ish icon  !IPS-X

To Use
------
Input, output and operation is as described in the book "IPS - High Level
Programming of Small Systems" by Karl Meinzer (1978), ISBN 0-9530507-0-X.
There are minor differences:

 - Standard words are in German, (lower case).
 - At errors, the offending word is displayed in inverse video and the cursor
   placed at the start of the word.
 - The cursor control keys may also be used.  

OUTPUT: Is virtually identical to IPS-N for the Atari 800XL etc

INPUT:  1. You enter commands by typing them in the usual way.

        2. Or you can read a file.  For example, enter:

          ~ ips-m/src ~ read   <ret>
      
Note that the default directory is called "Work" and is inside the
application.  Keep your hacks in there.

Quitting
--------
Hit ESCAPE.

If you hold down SHIFT at the same time, a screendump is placed in RAM disc.

Source files
------------
Source files are located in the directory  !IPS-X.Work .  Presently they are:

these notes.

"Work" is the default directory for compilation output.

                   About the IPS-X Cross Compiler
                   ------------------------------
The cross compiler is the same as normal IPS-M except that:

  a. All normal IPS words are in lower case, and letter-less words have an
     "n" appended.  The string delimiter is ~ .  Examples:
     
        hier  $h weg  kon  dup  !b  je  ja?
        :n  ;n  !n  'n  <n  =0n
        ~ SOME TEXT ~
  
  b. Facilities for cross-compiling have been added.

  c. The chain consists of the compiler and display handler only.
     Thus  einh and  aush  have been omitted.

At start up, you may use IPS exactly as normal, subject to the word
translation as above.


1. How it works
   ------------
All versions of IPS include a powerful compiler, so it is natural to use
this power to take IPS source files for an alien machine and cross assemble
them to a target image.

Thus in Cross-Compile Mode, commands in IPS are used for directives and
expressions.  In this way, the alien source files may be written in a
quasi-IPS style, interpreted by the cross-compiler and deposited in the
target image as a binary for direct loading to the target machine.

The target memory area is specified by the variable $O, and is #4000 by
default.  This value is chosen to be memorable, and it is well clear of
IPS' own workspace.  You can change it if you wish.

The system is in Cross-Compile mode whenever $O is non-zero, and in
Normal mode when $O = 0.

The value returned by  hier  is the LOGICAL address associated with the
current mode.  Thus when in X-compile mode you may write a directive such
as #200 $h !n .  This will make the target build continue at logical
address #200.  But the X-compiler maps this to PHYSICAL address #4200. 


2. Control
   -------
Three commands are provided to switch Modes.  They are of type :int and so
may not be used inside definitions.

 X>   "X go".    Enter X (cross-compile) mode, toggling all pointers
 
 <X   "From X".  Exit  X mode, toggling all pointers

 X>>  "X start". Enter X mode, initialising all pointers.


X> and <X are complementary, and you may use them freely to swap modes
without affecting either the normal IPS build or the target build as
appropriate.  If you are already in X mode, the command X> will be ignored
(inverse echo).  Likewise, from normal mode  <X is meaningless.

X>> is used to start up cross compilation mode from scratch, and would
normally be included at the start of the first alien source file.

The sequence  X>>  <X is equivalent to a soft reset; pointers are
initialised, but the target area is not wiped, and any new normal words are
retained.


3. Utilities
   ---------
These words are provided for you to include in alien source files.

$OC   Converts a logical address to physical address.
       <addr> $OC
       <addr + value of $O> 

!O    Store a word in image workspace.
       <n> <addr> !O           n stored at (addr + value of $O)
       <empty>


4. Using the Cross-Compiler
   ------------------------
This is best explained by examples.

4.1. Compiling IPS-M
     ---------------
IPS-M for Acorn Risc Computers needs an assembler, though only the four
words    i>  <i  ,  rcode .  These are simply affixed to the start of the
source file, which may then be compiled in one operation:

  ~ IPS-M/SRC ~ read
  
The output is a binary called M-bin, and is placed in the !IPS-X.Work.  It's
suggested you study IPS-M/SRC to understand the basic compiler directives.

If you want to repeat the above, first do    weg/ab i>    to delete the
so-called "assembler", which is the first definition in the source file.


4.2. Compiling IPS-C3 for AO-13's IHU
     --------------------------------
In the Work directory are three source files which re-create the AO-13
flight IPS-C3;  1802/ASM, LADER-C3/S and IPS-C3/SRC.

Step 1. Load the 1802 assembler;  enter:

          ~ 1802/ASM   ~ read 

Step 2. Cross-compile the first source file; enter:

          ~ LADER-C3/S ~ read

Step 2. Now enter:

          ~ IPS-C3/SRC ~ read

That's all!  You will find that in the work directory there is now a new
file called IPS-C3 which is ready to be loaded straight into your AO-13
IHU.  Just double-click on it, and away you go.

Explanation of the above Steps
------------------------------
First recall that the final image IPS-C3 is composed of two parts.  The
self-checking loader at #0-#200 exclusive, and the flight IPS image, logical
address #400-#1DA1 which is planted at #200-#1BA1 for upload, i.e. displaced
#200 bytes downwards. 


Step 1. IPS-X is a general purpose cross-compiler.  As it is about to
        work for a CDP-1802 target, it first needs the assembler to be loaded.

Step 2. Load the source file LADER-C3/S (in the work directory) into
        a text editor.  The first and last lines are similar to:
    
        X>>          ( Set cross compile mode, with reset)
        
        #0000 $h !n                          (Set to compile at address 0)
        #2020 #4000 !n #4000 #4001 511 l>>>  (Fill with #20s)
        
        NOP #0 DEC NOP 9 LD IM 1 PLO ...     (Assembly code)
         :
         :    (lots more code here)
         :
        #0 $OC hier $OC ~ LADER-C3 ~ $save     (Save the image)
       
        <X  ( Return to Normal mode )
        

Step 3. Study the source IPS-C3/SRC.  It begins and ends with:
        
        X>>  #3E00 $O !n   ( Set X-compile mode; move target )
                           ( zone down #200 bytes.            )
        (IPS-C3, SATELLITENVERSION, BAU DER SYSSEITE 26.6.86 )
        #0400 $h !n
         :
         :
         :
        #200 $OC hier $OC  ~ IPS-C3 ~ $save
        <X

        The device of temporarily setting $O to #200 lower than #4000
        means that the loader code previously compiled now appears to be
        in the logical space #200-#3FF, immediately before the IPS-C3
        compilation which begins at #0400.

        You can change $O like this because the loader part contains no
        IPS definitions, only assembly code.

        The save command above is equivalent to #4000 #5BC1 $save.  Both
        the Loader and IPS-C3 are saved as one entity

Command files/scripts
---------------------
As an alternative, requiring an extra step, it is perfectly feasible to
compile LADER-C3/S to #4000 and save its binary as LADER-C3; then
compile the IPS-C3/SRC part also to #4000 and save its binary as IPS-C3;
and then do a merging operation with:

  #0 #4000 !n #4000 #4001 #1FFF l>>> ( Clear #2000 bytes memory )
  
  #4000       ~ IPS-C3   ~ $load ( IPS-C3.  Now overlay the )
  #4000       ~ LADER-C3 ~ $load ( self checking loader     )
  #4000 #5C00 ~ IPS-C3   ~ $save ( Loader + IPS-C3 )

But that's a lot of typing.  Much the best way to do project management is
to keep long winded invocations like this in command files.  The above is
in a file called "merge".  So after compiling, enter:

  ~ merge ~ read 
                               --+--

The command file "merge/crc" is even more powerful.

It will load LADER-C3 and IPS-C3 into memory, and then compute the 14 CRCC
checks and re-plant them into LADER-C3.  The output image is called IPS-C4.

This script allows you to tinker with IPS-C3/SRC, and end up with an IHU
loadable image with all the CRCs correct.  Just enter:

   ~ merge/crc ~ read


5. For Advanced Users
   ------------------
If you find it tedious to keep loading 1802/ASM before compiling a source
file, here are two alternatives:

   1. You can prefix your source material with the assembler definitions.
   
   2. Alternatively you can easily build a specifically 1802 cross-assembler
      (like the old IPS-X1802), as follows:
   
   Edit the !IPS-X.!Run file so that the start-up binary file
   is   Work.X1802-bin  (rather than the standard X-bin).  Now this is
   already in the !Run file, and merely needs the out-comment "|" to
   be moved up a line.
   

   Note that the file X1802-bin was previously created (by me) thus:
     1. Run IPS-X
     2. Load the 1802 assembler by entering:  ~ 1802/ASM ~ read
     3. Save out the IPS memory:    #0 hier ~ X1802-bin ~ $save        
      

6. Cautions/Tips
   -------------
1. Note that a command file can only invoke ONE other command file, and that
   MUST be the LAST item in the file.  This is because the invoked file will
   overwrite the calling file that's presently in the input buffer.

2. IPS can only search for words in the target area when in X-compile mode.

3. ?n <name>  returns the physical address of name's parameter field,
              subject to 2 above.

4. weg/ab <name> may be used conventionally, subject to 2 above.
                 Fortunately, if you delete a normal definition you won't
                 delete any following target material ...

5. Do not place a :n definition at logical address #0, otherwise it
   cannot be found during a name search.  To obviate that, a X-compile mode
   default value of $h = 2 is used.  You are unlikely to want to put a
   definition at #0, as that page is usually used for system purposes,
   not IPS definitions.
   
6. Don't try to execute words belonging to the target image!  They are
   meaningless commands to the host IPS, so you will probably crash the
   system.  A common error is to type WEG (which is probably a target
   definition) when you meant "weg".  To avoid this sort of finger trouble,
   always use <X to return to normal mode before you start messing about.
   Invocations of target words will then be ignored.

   Another slip is to type 0 1 2 4 when still in X-compile mode.  0 1 2 4 are
   defined as kon under IPS-C3, so if you are still in X-compile mode and you
   use (say) 0, you will crash the system.  Use #0 or 00 etc instead.

Directive Translations
----------------------
The ability to use words :n  var kon   42  ja? je nun +nun ;n   as
convenient directives in an alien source file is very useful.  But it does
also mean that a translation table is needed so that in Cross-compile mode
target words are used rather than host words.

For example, in Normal mode,   #1234  would compile to  [2bliteral] [#1234]
whereas in X-compile mode it must compile to [2BLITERAL] [#1234] where the
uppercase word is already defined for the target.

To this end, a translation table is maintained in the 12 word field $ccodes.
The addresses carried in it are:

  $ccodes    Target word
   offset      address

      0        DEFEX        )

 $ccodes+22 is used as the name link list pointer for the target during
 X-compilation, instead of the normal   link .
