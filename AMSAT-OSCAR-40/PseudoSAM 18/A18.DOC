Chapter 1 PseudoSam 18 assembler vs. the RCA assembler

     All PseudoSam(Pseudo brand Symbolic AsseMbler) assemblers conform to
     a common syntax based on the UNIX system V assembler syntax. By
     conforming to this Pseudo standard, conflicts with the manufacturers
     syntax are created.  Below is a brief and incomplete list of those
     conflicts.

      RCA format  level 1                 PseudoSam format

<identifier> equ <expression>         .equ <identifier> , <expression>

<identifier> set <expression>         .set <identifier> , <expression>

Has Macro capability                  No Macro capability at this time

..coments are delimited by            ;coments are delimited by
.. two periods                        ; a single semicolon


* The difference between the RCA and the PseudoSam name
  of an assembler directive can be circumvented by the .opdef
  directive.

  example

   .opdef  eject,.eject      ;defines eject to be synonymous with .eject

*  A file syn.asm is distributed with the assembler with some useful
   redefinitions.

Chapter 2  Running the assembler program

1.  Command line switch setting and source file specification.

     Assuming the user has an assembly language source file called foo.asm
     type the following command:

a18 foo

     The assembler will assemble the program foo.asm using the default
     assembler switch settings. the following files will be generated
     by the assembler:

     foo.lst   ;assembled listing shown the code conversion and
               ; any errors that where discover by the assembler.

     foo.obj   ;assembled object code in Motorola Hex format.

**  for a list of switch setting see the .command assembler directive
    description in chapter 6.

*** The assembler uses the following temporary file names.

    z0z0z0z0.tmp
    z1z1z1z1.tmp

    ANY files with these names will be DESTROYED by the
    by the assembler.







Chapter 3  Assembler statement syntax

1. Assembler Statements

     Assembler statements contain from zero to 4 fields as shown in
     following.

<label> <opcode> <expressions> <comment>

     All fields are optional, but they must be in this order.

A.   Labels (<label>) are symbolic names that are assigned the starting
     address of any code generated by the opcode and or expressions
     of the line containing the label declaration.(see section 2).

B.   Operation codes(<opcode>) tell the assembler what machine instruction
     to generate, or what assembler control function to perform.
     The operation code also tells the assembler what expressions are
     required to complete the machine instruction or assembler directive.
     (see chapter 6).

C.   Expression requirements are set by the opcode(see the microprocessor
     manufacturers reference manual or the assembler directives chapter
     for individual opcode requirements).(see chapter 5).

D.   Comments are notes written by the programmer to explain what the
     program is trying to accomplish. Comments generate no code.
     (see section 3).







2.  Labels

     Labels can be unlimited in length, but only the first eight characters
     are used to distinguish between them.  They must conform to the
     following syntax.

     <label>  -> <identifier>':'

     <identifier> -> <alphabetic character> <identifier character string>

     <alphabetic character> -> character in the set ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '.']

     <identifier character string> -> any sequence of characters from the
                                      set ['A'..'Z','a'..'z', '.', '0'..'9']

example
abc:                  ;label referred to as abc
a c:                  ;not a valid label
         foo:         ;label referred to as foo
.123:                 ;label referred to as .123

* Case makes NO difference!

d:      ;is the same as
D:


3.  Comments
     Comments must start with a semi-colon ; and are terminated
     by an end of line or file( <lf>(^J) or <sub>(^Z) ). An end
     of line is inserted by typing the enter or return key by
     most text editors.







Chapter 4     Data types

1.  Integers

    Integer constants can be specified in any of the following forms:

A.  Binary

    b'bb             ;bb=string of binary digits
    B'bb

B.  Decimal

    ndd
    d'dd             ;n=nozero decimal digit
    D'dd             ;dd=string of decimal digits

C.  Octal

    0qq              ;qq=string of octal digits
    o'qq
    O'qq
    q'qq
    Q'qq

D.  Hexidecimal

    0x'hh            ;hh=string of hexidecimal digits
    0X'hh
    h'hh
    H'hh
    x'hh
    X'hh


Examples:

    077        ;octal number 77 = decimal 63
    b'0101     ;binary number 101 = decimal 5
    77         ;decimal number 77 = octal 115
    h'ff       ;hexidecimal ff = decimal 255






2.  Strings:

    Strings consist of a beginning quote " followed by any reasonable number
    of characters followed by an ending quote ". Control characters and double
    quotes " and backslash \ may not be used in strings directly.  These
    special characters are included by using a special escape sequence which
    the assembler translates into the appropriate ASCII code.

Note: Strings may not be used in expressions!
      Although character constants may(see below).

Escape sequences
  "\"" string containing "
  "\\" string containing \
  "\'" string containing '
  "\0" string containing null
  "\n" string containing linefeed
  "\r" string containing carriage return
  "\f" string containing formfeed
  "\t" string containing horizontal tab
  "\nnn" string containing the ASCII character who's code is o'nnn
         (nnn are octal digits).
  * see appendix A for ASCII codes.

3.  Character Constants:

    Character constants consist of  a single quote ' followed by
    a character or an escape sequence(see above) followed by a
    single quote '.

example:
   'A' = ASCII character value for the letter A = 65 (decimal);
   '\''= ASCII character value for the character ' = 39 (decimal).

Character constants are treated as integers by the assembler and
are valid where ever an integer value is valid.

example:
   'A' + 1 = 66

  * see appendix A for ASCII codes.

4.  Symbolic values

    Symbolic values are generally labels, but may be any identifier
    assigned an integer value(using .set or .equ pseudo-ops).

    As a special case the symbol * when used as an operand in an
    expression denotes the value of the location counter (the value
    the program counter will have during operation) at the beginning
    of the current line.






Chapter 5  Expressions

     All expressions evaluate to integer values modulo 65536(2^16) and are
     written in infix notation(the way you normally write them).  Operators
     provided are grouped below in order of precedence.

1. (unary)
~           logical bit wise complement(not) of its operand(one's complement).
-           arithemetic complement, or negation(two's complement).

2. (binary)
*           integer multiply (two's complement).
/           integer divide   (two's complement).
%           modulus          (result is always positive)
>>          logical shift right (left operand shifted right operand times).
<<          logical shift left (left operand shifted right operand times).
~           equivalent to  A or ( ~B ).

3. (binary)
|           logical bitwise or(inclusive-or) of two operands.
^           logical bitwise exclusive-or of two operands.
&           logical bitwise and of two operands.

4. (binary)
+           addition (two's complement).
-           subtraction (two's complement).

     Since this version does not generate relocatable code there exists only
     one "type" of operand that can be in an expression.  So anything goes
     except divide by 0(1 will be substituted ).

examples:
    -1 = h'ffff  (two's complement notation).
    -1 >> 8 = h'00ff
    -1 << 8 = h'ff00
    3 / 2 = 1
    6 / 2 = 3
    5 / 0 = 5
    -2 / 1 = -2
    -3 /-2 = 1
    2 * -3 = -6
    b'00 & b'11 = 0
    b'11 & b'10 = 2
    2 * b'01 & b'10 = 2
    b'01 ^ b'11 = 2
    b'01 | b'11 = 3

Notice that spaces are ignored in expressions.

        2. Suggestions, comments, and bug reports.

        3. Spread the word.  Make copies for friends.  Write the editor
           of your favorite computer magazine.  Astronomical advertising
           costs are one big reason that commercial software is so over-
           priced.  To continue offering PseudoSam 18 this way, we need
           your help in letting other people know about PseudoSam 18.

        Those who make the $30 payment to become registered users
        receive the following benefits:(order form on next page)

        1. One year of updates including any upgrades. This includes
           at least one new version release even if it takes more than
           one year.

        2. User support by mail.  Support is only available to registered
           users.  The address for help is given below.

      Although each version of PseudoSam 18 is tested extensively prior
      to release, any program is bound to contain a few bugs.  It is
      the intention of PseudoCode to correct any genuine problem that
      is reported.

      If you think you have found a bug in PseudoSam 18, please take the time
      to report it for correction.  Although any report is helpful,
      correction of the problem will be easiest if you provide the
      following:

         1. The version of PseudoSam 18 you are using.  Your problem may have
            been fixed already.

         2. A brief description of the problem.

         3. A copy of the problem source file, preferably on a floppy disk.
            (The cost of floppies is so small($.29), they will not be
             returned and become the property of PseudoCode.)

            * It is NOT necessary to send a large program to demonstrate
              problem.  Please try to isolate the problem area, by
              writing a short sample program that demonstrates the bug.

      Appendix E   Using PseudoSam 18 on "Compatible" Systems.

      PseudoSam 18 was written specifically for the IBM PC, but should
      function normally on true "compatibles".

      Since PseudoSam 18 version 1.2.00 is a totally new program, little
      compatibility data is currently available.  If you are using (or
      are unable to use...) PseudoSam 18 on a non-IBM computer, please
      write with your experiences.  Does PseudoSam 18 work correctly on
      your system?  Are there specific problem areas?  Can they be worked
      around?

      The following systems are known to run PseudoSam 18 version 1.2.00
      successfully:
             IBM PC
             IBM XT
             IBM AT
             Sperry PC (all models).
             JDR Microdevices PC Clones.
